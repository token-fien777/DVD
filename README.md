https://etherscan.io/token/0x77dcE26c03a9B833fc2D7C31C22Da4f42e9d9582

#### The smart contract is still under development (testing and auditing) and we strongly advise anyone not to deposit anything on the mainnet until we publicly launch the product.

## Definition and description

$DVD tokens are governance tokens built on erc-20 Ethereum blockchain. This is release every block based on % of LP funds into $DVD smart contract pools.

$DVD are essentially “tokens” on a smart contract that are programmatically developed and enforced based on fixed criteria written on mandate.

These rules can be changed/updated through a consensus voting mechanism built into the governance smart contract.

The best method to acquire $DVD token is through participating in the staking of funds into $DVD product’s smart contract. Works exactly as “vesting shares” in a typical technology startup.

## Governance Token metrics and highlights

### Objective

Incentives mechanism to attract and stake liquidity
Market participation from community ensuring network effect
Long term demand from governance token & community involvement

### Token model 

- Initial market cap. Very small market cap at launch.
- Deflationary model. Block rewards reduction every 2 weeks for 4 years. 
- Low Inflation. Less than 100k DVD tokens daily. 
- Fair launch. No pre-mine for team/advisors. 
- High liquidity. With 1% allocation for liquidity at AMM.

## Governance Token Distribution Summary

Using a simpler model for calculation that crypto investors would understand. We architect and implemented the deflationary rewards model.

- 51% for LP liquidity 
- 30 $DVD per block on Ethereum
- Less than 100k token distributed to reduce daily inflation

Deflationary model to reduce “selling pressure” in the market; 3.5% block rewards reduction bi-weekly.

By the 4 years cycle, all the block rewards will be fully distributed by the smart contract. 

## Governance Token Framework

A simple governance framework with $DVD token holders can easily participate in shaping the direction of the DAO protocol. 

Each $DVD token is counted as 1 vote.

Anyone with 1000 $DVD token in their delegated address can vote any governance plan; these are simple or complex sets of plan, such as:
propose custom quant strategies,changing priorities on integrations, other functions that LP deems suitable for funds direction.

All proposals are subject to a 3 day voting period, and any address with voting power can vote for or against the proposal. If a majority votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 2 days.

### Voting
All voting are done at Snapshot.page for easier management and save gas.

### Quorum
The quorum is 20%. Which means that 20% of the staked $DVD needs to vote on a proposal for it to pass, or else it will fail. Also, it has to have at least 51% of the votes for yes. All of this is executed on smart contracts.
